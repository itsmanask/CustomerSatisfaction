## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology Highlights

- **Descriptive Statistics**:  
   - Analyzing data distributions, central tendencies (mean, median), and variability (standard deviation) to understand the dataset.

- **Hypothesis Testing**:  
   - **t-tests** used to assess the significance of differences in satisfaction scores based on different customer segments.

- **Correlation Analysis**:  
   - Exploring the relationships between demographic features and customer satisfaction using correlation metrics.

- **Regression Modeling**:  
   - Applied to model the impact of demographics and product type on customer satisfaction scores.

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models

- **Logistic Regression**:  
   - Used to predict binary outcomes (e.g., satisfied vs unsatisfied) based on customer demographics.

- **Decision Tree**:  
   - Visualizes the decision-making process for predicting customer satisfaction and allows for easy interpretability.
